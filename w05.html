        <h2>An Introduction</h2>
        <p>2048 is a popular single-player sliding block puzzle game. The game is played on a 4×4 grid, and the objective is to combine tiles with the same number to create a tile with the value of 2048. Each time the player makes a move, a new tile appears on the board with a value of either 2 or 4. The player can move the tiles in four directions: up, down, left, and right. When the player makes a move, all the tiles on the board slide as far as possible in the chosen direction. If two tiles with the same value collide, they merge into a single tile with the value of their sum. The game ends when there are no more moves to make. A common misconception is that the game also ends when the 2048 tile is reached, but in truth the player can continue infinitely.

        <h2>A History</h2>
        <p>The game was created by nineteen-year-old Italian web developer Gabriele Cirulli in March 2014, who coded the game in a single weekend as a test to see if he could program a game from scratch. He published his 2048 on GitHub, and dropped a link on a design website, hoping for some feedback. The web game ended up on Hacker News, and spread from there. Suddenly, Cirulli was receiving congratulations from friends on Facebook. He checked Google Analytics and saw, at first, that 150 people were playing the game at one time. Then he watched it balloon to 13,000 active users. Interview requests started coming in. Italy’s national TV station called him. The game was everywhere.</p>

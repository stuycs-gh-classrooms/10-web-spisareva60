       Carbon fixation, the first stage of the Calvin cycle, uses carbon from carbon dioxide to form an organic molecule. In plants, carbon dioxide enters the mesophyll layer of leaves by passing through pore-like structures called stomata, and then diffusing into mesophyll cells, and into the stroma of chloroplasts, where the Calvin cycle can begin. 
The enzyme ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO) catalyzes the addition of a molecule of carbon dioxide (CO2) to a five-carbon sugar known as ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP). This results in an unstable 6-carbon molecule, which splits into two molecules of a three-carbon compound called 3-phosphoglycerate (3-PGA). This reaction is referred to as carboxylation.

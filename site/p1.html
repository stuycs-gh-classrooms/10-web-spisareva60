       The reduction stage of the Calvin cycle occurs in two major steps. Firstly, each molecule of 3-PGA produced by carbon fixation receives a phosphate group from ATP, becoming the molecule 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate. This reaction produces ADP as a byproduct. 
Secondly, the 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate molecules are reduced (gain two electrons from NADPH) and lose one of their phosphate groups, turning into a three-carbon sugar called glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P). This step produces NADP+ and phosphate as byproducts.

The ATP and NADPH used in these steps are both products of the light-dependent reactions (the first stage of photosynthesis). The Calvin cycle regenerates the ADP and NADP+ needed for the light reactions. Therefore, the light and dark reactions of photosynthesis are interdependent.
